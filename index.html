  <p>In an effort to enable individuals seeking to engage in stewardship opportunities to more easily find and join their local watershed group(s) and connect with other stewardship based organizations in their area, ICPRB has created a web-based map displaying watershed groups/organizations within the Potomac basin.<br></br>
Additionally, an information sharing system in which success stories, trials and tribulations, and funding information can be shared, has been created via the Potomac Basin Stewards group on the Chesapeake Network.  Greater communication among the watershed's groups can strengthen the activities of each one.<br></br>
Results of the 2010 Potomac River Basin Watershed Group Survey have been compiled and can be viewed here.<br></br>
If you have questions, suggestions or comments, please contact us at info@icprb.org or 301-274-8107.<br></br>
